You've joined the long list of people who have asked me "what should I do in New York?" and "where should I go eat?" Hopefully the list below gives you a place to start doing research.    <br><br>
These are my favorite places and activities I think are worth doing. Most of these suggestions are in Manhattan, where I live and work. Please take the time to see the other boroughs. See something on here that I've forgotten? Please reach out!    <br>
