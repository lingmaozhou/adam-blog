You've joined the long list of people who have asked me "what should I do in New York?" and "where should I go eat?" Hopefully the list below gives you a place to start doing research.  <br>
These are my favorite places and activities I think are worth doing. Stop any New Yorker on the street, and they'll disagree with something on this list, but you chose to ask me! See something on here that I've forgotten? Please reach out! <br>  
For my map lovers, my Google Maps link is here:
