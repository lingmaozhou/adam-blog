about-author: Hi! I'm Ling. I'm a strategy consultant and a Wellesley grad (2019) based out of New York City.
I'm a southern girl at heart and spent most of my life in a suburb of Atlanta. I haven't complained too much about giving up my horses and endless land for the city that never sleeps. When I'm not traveling for work, you can find me cooking in my apartment, at the gym, or exploring the best of what NYC has to offer.
